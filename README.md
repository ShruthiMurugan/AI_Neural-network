This repository holds the code for a simple neural network that simulates various logic gates. 
It uses backpropagation to learn the relationships between input and output for different gates.

Features:

1.Simulates OR, NOR, AND, NAND, XOR, and NXOR gates.

2.Trains the network using provided training data.

3.Interactive menu for training and using the simulator.

Training:

1.Select "Train neural network" from the menu.

2.Enter the desired number of training epochs (range: 100,000 - 10,000,000).

3.The network will train on the provided data and update its weights accordingly.

Simulating Logic Gates:

1.Select "Use Logic Simulator" from the menu.

2.Choose the gate you want to simulate (e.g., OR, AND).

3.Enter binary input values for the gate (e.g. "1 0" for two inputs).

4.The network will process the inputs and output the calculated result.
